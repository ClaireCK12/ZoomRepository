    <div class="box section3"><h2>WHAT WE DO:</h2> Zoom LTL Freight was founded in 1924 in Dublin, Ireland by the Kennedy Family who were produce dealers who realized that there was more success in delivering produce than selling it. The first Zoom truck was the family car with the rear seats removed. Today, Zoom is a billion euro plus powerhouse with nearly <strong>70 terminals</strong> and offices in <strong>12 European countries</strong>. Through our partner network, we serve the balance of Europe via <strong>LAND</strong>, <strong>SEA</strong> and <strong>AIR</strong>. With headquarters in Dublin, Zoom employs 1,050 people nationwide. Zoom LTL Freight has been recognized by the European Trucking Associations Safety Management Council for its outstanding safety record. We believe our mission statement says it all. At Zoom, we work to safely drive our customers' success with custom solutions built on the <em>three pillars of our service-focused values</em>: <strong>people</strong>, <strong>purpose</strong> and <strong>performance</strong>. </div> <!--What We Do Text -->
